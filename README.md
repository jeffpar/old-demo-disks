## PCjs Demo Disk Archive

The [PCjs Demo Disk Archive](https://github.com/jeffpar/old-demo-disks) was a repository of disk images
for use as a submodule with the original [PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs).

Both of those repositories have been superseded by the new [PCjs Machines Repository](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs.org) and [PCjs Diskette Repository](https://diskettes.pcjs.org/).
